# Opinion poll theme arrangement
Determine your preferred political party to vote on by arranging a list of political themes.
After having determined your political party, additional questions are asked to determine how the constituent would like to see issue under these themes (only those highest on the self-created arrangement) being addressed in practice. The latter is done by starting vlevit's q10r.
