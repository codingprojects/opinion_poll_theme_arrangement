The program first asks to list the following political themes from 1 to 10, in descending order, starting with the one you 
are most concerned about to the one you are least concerned about. The order in how you list the first themes will be the most
important to have you vote for party A rather then party B, C, ..
* economy
* environment (includes horticulture)
* energy
* transport
* immigration
* safety
* health care
* education
* science (includes space exploration)
* culture (includes sports)
* infrastructure
* agriculture

The program will then select your preferred political party based on this arrangement and output it for you to read (before going
to actually vote). This party choice should match with you quite well because those themes the party is most concerned about will
also be those themes you are most concerned about.
The approach you prefer on how issues under these themes would be tackled by the party may differ from that of the approach put
forward by the political party however. So, to increase opinion precision, Vlevit's q10r is then started with a set of questions on
your 3 highest-rated themes. These answered questions are then stored, for possible transmitting to the political party.
