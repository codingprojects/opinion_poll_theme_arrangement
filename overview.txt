your listing was still close enough to have you vote automatically for them.

The party X (which you voted for) gas following thoughts on their political themes. Do you agree with these 
(answer yes or no).

Intermediate thoughts (which the political party did not put forward but which are between their thoughts, 
and the negative response you gave on that particular issue will also be presented. For instance if
trying to address pollution from energy production (under theme:energy) and the party is for switching to 
100% renewable energy (which you oppose), it will start giving yes/no questions on whether
you like things such as installing new nuclear power plants, implementing carbon capture and storage on old fossil 
power plants, ... instead.

The questions you answered with a yes, will then be forwarded to the appropriate political party as well, together with 
the theme ordering
